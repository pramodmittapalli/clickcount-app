Clickcount
==========

What is Clickcount?
-------------------

Clickcount is a mobile application based on the jQTouch and PhoneGap projects. It uses identical frontend code to create an application for both Android and iPhone - all the rest of the packages were built using the PhoneGap project.

This is meant to be a demo of the capabilities of PhoneGap alongside web standard technologies like Javascript, HTML and CSS. Isn't it great that you can make one page of code and it will run on all the biggest platforms?

How should I use this?
----------------------

However you want. This project is just for people to see how easy it is to make mobile applications. Feel free to even release this application on the Android Market and iTunes App Store if you want - I haven't bothered.

Just read the code, and see how well it works.
